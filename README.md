## Hi there, I'm Pierre!


> I am a full-stack developer currently living in London. Most experienced with Javascript technologies but always looking to expand my skillset and learn new tools in my efforts to build useful software.

## 🚀 Past and current projects

### Current project:

- <img height="20" alt="Your Family Paediatrician" src="./readme-assets/logo-yfp.svg" style="padding-right: 0.5rem">[Your Family Paediatrician](https://github.com/PLejay/your-family-paediatrician), a landing page for my wife’s paediatrician private service built using Astro and Typescript. I am more used to building interactive web apps than landing pages so this is a good practice in something a bit different!

### Past projects:

- <img height="20" alt="Remedic" src="./readme-assets/logo-explicit-ts-exports.png" style="padding-right: 0.5rem">[Explicit TS Exports](https://github.com/PLejay/explicit-ts-exports), a VS Code extension adding a command to quickly generate an index.ts file for a folder of typescript files. Built using the [TypeScript Compiler API](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Using-the-Compiler-API)

- <img height="20" alt="Remedic" src="./readme-assets/logo-remedic.svg" style="padding-right: 0.5rem">[Remedic](https://github.com/alexanderjshall/remedic-app), a full-stack app that provides an in-person patient-doctor consultation across a language-barrier without using a translator. Built in a team of 6 people using React and Tailwind CSS in the front end, GraphQL, Typescript, and Express and PostgreSQL in the back end.

- <img height="20" alt="Quizzie" src="./readme-assets/logo-quizzie.png" style="padding-right: 0.5rem"> [Quizzie](https://github.com/PLejay/quizzie), a web app allowing users to create randomized quizzes based on collections of card-based questions. Solo 1-week project built using React in the front end, Typescript and Express and MongoDB in the back end.
